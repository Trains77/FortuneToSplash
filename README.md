# FortuneToSplash

Converts fortune files into a minecraft resource pack

This script converts files for the CLI program [Fortune](https://github.com/shlomif/fortune-mod) into a Minecraft resource pack, because why not

How to run: `python main.py FORTUNE_FILES`


## What I plan to add:

Support for fortunes that span multiple lines

## System support

It should work on any platform, however it has only been tested on Linux
