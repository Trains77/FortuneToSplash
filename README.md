# FortuneToSplash

Converts fortune files into a minecraft resource pack

This script converts files for the CLI program [Fortune](https://github.com/shlomif/fortune-mod) into a Minecraft resource pack, because why not

How to run: `python main.py FORTUNE_FILES`

## System Support

It should work on any platform, however it has only been tested on Linux

## Known Issues

Large fortunes appear as really small and hard to read text, there is no real fix for this without modding the game itself
