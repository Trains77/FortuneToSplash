# FortuneToSplash

Converts fortune files into a minecraft resource pack

This script converts files for the CLI program [Fortune](https://github.com/shlomif/fortune-mod) into a Minecraft resource pack, because why not

This script has been tested on Linux, but it should work on MacOS and Windows


How to run: `python main.py PATH_TO_FORTUNE_FILE`


## What I plan to add:

Multiple fortune files support
